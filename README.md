*MCP Weather Server*
Documentation Reference: This project follows the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) Quickstart guide to build and integrate the MCP server.
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop
This is a simple MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes weather tools (`get-alerts` and `get-forecast`) to be used by AI agents or custom applications.

*Features*

- Exposes two tools: 
  - `get-alerts`: Returns weather alerts for a given location
  - `get-forecast`: Returns the weather forecast for a given location
- Built using Python
- MCP-compatible: Can be used with Claude or any custom app via HTTP+JSON-RPC

*Steps to Run This Repository on Your System*

Follow the steps below to clone, set up, and run the MCP server:

1. Clone the Repository
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Install Claude Desktop
   
Download and install Claude for Desktop from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop.

4. Run the MCP Server
To start the server:

mcp run file_name.py
To run the server with MCP Inspector (helpful for debugging):

mcp dev file_name.py

5. Integrate the Server with Claude Desktop
To let Claude use your serverâ€™s tools, run:
mcp install file_name.py

You should see this confirmation in your terminal:
Added server 'weather' to Claude config
Successfully installed weather in Claude app

This means your MCP weather server is successfully integrated with Claude Desktop and ready to use.
